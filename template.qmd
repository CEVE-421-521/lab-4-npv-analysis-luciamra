```{julia}

include("depthdamage.jl")
```

## Building the Case Study
Here, we are using existing data to build a depth-damage function.

```{julia}
haz_fl_dept = CSV.read("data/haz_fl_dept.csv", DataFrame) # read in the file
desc = "Cafeteria Restaurant, structure"
row = @rsubset(haz_fl_dept, :Description == desc)[1, :] # select the row I want
dd = DepthDamageData(row) # extract the depth-damage data
damage_fn = get_depth_damage_function(dd.depths, dd.damages) # get the depth-damage function
```

Now we must offset the function by the height of the building we are annalyzing in relation to the guage. We can then run a Monte Carlo approach to estemate the expected cost of flooding.

```{julia}
gauge_dist = GeneralizedExtremeValue(5, 1, 0.1) # hypothetical gauge distribution
offset = 3.74 # hypothetical height from house to gauge
house_dist = GeneralizedExtremeValue(gauge_dist.μ - offset, gauge_dist.σ, gauge_dist.ξ)

samples = rand(house_dist, 100_000) .* 1u"ft"
damages = damage_fn.(samples)
expected_damages_pct = mean(damages)
```

These damages are expressed as a percentage of the value fo the house, so we must input data on the actual value of the house to turn this damage amount into cost. I used Zillow in Galveston to get a sense of the value of the homes in the area that I am analyzing. There is a significant range but tend to be around $400,000.

```{julia}
house_structure_value = 400000
expected_damages_usd = house_structure_value * expected_damages_pct / 100
```

To evaluate the cost of elevating we use a piecewise linear function that depends on the area of the hosue and how high we elevate.


```{julia}
house_area = 4004u"ft^2"
house_value = 400000
elevation_cost = get_elevation_cost_function() # gives us a fitted interpolator
```

## Single Year Function
This function will tell us our costs and benefits in a single year looking at distribution of flooding, depth-damage function, cost of elevation, house value, and how high the house is elevated in the given year.

```{julia}
function single_year_cost_benefit(flood_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, Δh)
    
    # calculate the expected damages
    new_flood_dist = GeneralizedExtremeValue(flood_dist.μ - ustrip(Δh), flood_dist.σ, flood_dist.ξ)

    samples = rand(new_flood_dist, 100_000) .* 1u"ft"
    damages = damage_fn.(samples)
    expected_damages_pct = mean(damages)

    expected_damages_usd = house_structure_value * expected_damages_pct / 100
    c_dmg = expected_damages_usd

    # calculate the cost of elevating
    c_constr = elevation_cost(Δh, house_area)

    # return the total cost and benefit
    return -c_constr - c_dmg
end

test = single_year_cost_benefit(house_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, 3.0*u"ft")
```

## NPV Function
This function will calculate the net present value (NPV) over a T year design window.

```{julia}
function npv_cost_benefit(house_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, Δh, T, discount_rate)
    time = 1:T
    expected_damages_usd = []
    if time == 1
        year1 = single_year_cost_benefit(house_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, Δh)
        push!(expected_damages_usd, year1)
    else
        new_flood_dist = GeneralizedExtremeValue(house_dist.μ - ustrip(Δh), house_dist.σ, house_dist.ξ)
        otheryears = single_year_cost_benefit(new_flood_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, 0*u"ft")
        push!(expected_damages_usd, otheryears)
    end
    npv = sum(expected_damages_usd .* (1 - discount_rate) .^ (0:T)) # discounting the damages to net present value and adding together
    return npv
end
```

## House Elevation NPVs
Now that we have a function for the net present value (NPV) of a home for a given elevations. We can test it out at different elevations.

To begin, we will test the home at an elevation of Δh=3ft as per Galvestons guidelines for land development.

```{julia}
# npv_cost_benefit(damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_structure_value, offset, 10, discount_rate)
h3 = npv_cost_benefit(house_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, 3.0*u"ft", 10, 0.05)
```

## Sensitivity Analysis
Assuming the discount rate is uncertain, we can use the Monte Carlo Aapproach to estimate the expected NPV for a range of discount rates.

```{julia}
N=1000000
discount_rate_dist = Normal(4, 2)
sample3 = rand(discount_rate_dist, N)
result3 = npv_cost_benefit.(house_dist, damage_fn, elevation_cost, house_area, house_value, 3.0*u"ft", 10, sample3)
mean(result3)
```
